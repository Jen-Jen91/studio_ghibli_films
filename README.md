# Studio Ghibli

This front-end project makes a request to the Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) and displays the film data. Users can choose to view all Studio Ghibli films or access specific titles using the dropdown selectors. The app was written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS.


### To run the app:

* In the terminal, run the following commands:
    1) *npm install*
    2) *npm run build* (keep this running and open another tab)
    3) *open public/index.html*
